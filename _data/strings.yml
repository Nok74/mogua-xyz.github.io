  about_description: |
    Founded by Bram Cohen, the inventor of the BitTorrent network, mogua Network is building a better blockchain and smart transaction platform which is more decentralized, more efficient, and more secure.

    Chialisp is Chia’s new smart transaction programming language that is powerful, easy to audit, and secure. The blockchain is powered by the first new Nakamoto style consensus algorithm since Bitcoin launched in 2008. Proofs of Space and Time replace energy intensive “proofs of work” by utilizing unused disk space.

    mogua Network supports the development and deployment of the Chia blockchain globally. mogua Network supports chia developers and supports the enterprise use of chia with software support and chia lending.
  about_team_title: "Team"
  about_team_description: |
    mogua Network was founded by the creator of BitTorrent, [Bram Cohen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cohenbram/). It also includes executive leadership from the former founder and CEO of eMusic.com and Vindicia, [Gene Hoffman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gehoffman/) and the former acting-CEO of Overstock.com, [Mitch Edwards](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchelledwards/). The Chia blockchain has an active open source developer community with many contributions to the codebase. Many individuals contribute towards the Chia blockchain in areas which include research, peer reviews, development, testing, documentation, and translation.

    **Chia is hiring!**

    We believe that anyone should be able to farm and that cryptocurrency should be easier to use and more secure than cash. That means we need people who want to create internet class user experience on the most secure blockchain and smart transaction platform created so far.

    Many on the Chia team are located in the SF Bay Area but remote is fine as we have people all over the world - Keybase, GitHub, and Zoom are how we work. Geographic restrictions, if any, will be noted in a job specification.

    Please send your resume and cover letter to [jobs@chia.net](jobs@chia.net). Please put the role you are applying for as part of the subject line and include anything additionally required by a specific job posting.

  green_paper_description: |
    The Green Paper details a new consensus algorithm called Proofs of Space and Time, “PoST”. PoST replaces the Proof of Work which wastes massive amounts of energy and is less secure against mining centralization.
  green_paper_addendum_title: "Learn more"
  green_paper_addendum: |
    We have academic papers and presentations that give detail about our new consensus algorithm and blockchain software. In 2019 we revealed our [Green Paper](https://www.chia.net/assets/ChiaGreenPaper.pdf) outlining the construction of Proofs of Space and Time and illustrating many of the design choices of Chia. There is also a [2019 talk from Mariano Sorgente](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_075bzQPooU) at MIT on how to achieve Nakamoto consensus with Proof of Space and VDFs.

    Bram Cohen [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zlcgt8FVz4) at Stanford on February 2018 on Proofs of Space. Our advisors, Dan Boneh, Benedikt Bünz, and Ben Fisch [published a survey of VDFs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/712.pdf) which are the underlying technology of Proof of Time. Lipa Long [published an explanation of class groups](https://github.com/Chia-Network/vdf-competition/blob/master/classgroups.pdf) that our [Proofs of Time](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/627.pdf) is based on. Bram presented [Beyond Hellman’s Time-Memory Trade-Offs with Applications to Proofs of Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqxkO7C-cyk) at BPASE ‘18 in January 2018 based on the [academic paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/893) and these [slides](https://view.publitas.com/chia-network/pbase18slides/page/1) by Hamza Abusalah. Ben Fisch gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUoagL7OZ1k) at BPASE 2018 in January 2018 on Verifiable Delay Functions. Bram [spoke at Blockchain at Berkeley](https://www.facebook.com/BlockchainatBerkeley/videos/2006069823011271/) (which starts about 20:00) in March 2018 with [slides](https://cyber.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj9936/f/bramcohen.pdf). Bram gave a [talk at BPASE 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYG0NxoG7yw) in January 2017 on removing waste with Proofs of Space and Time ([slides](https://cyber.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj9936/f/bramcohen.pdf)).

    Bram gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZaB4hM8SQ4) at SF Bitcoin Devs Seminar about data structures for scaling Bitcoin with [slides](https://view.publitas.com/chia-network/bitcoin_data_structures/) and [Merkle Set code](https://github.com/bramcohen/MerkleSet). Bram gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZaB4hM8SQ4) at SF Bitcoin Devs Seminar about removing waste from cryptocurrencies.

      paragraph_1: "A few months ago we wrapped up our initial VDF implementation competition and were amazed by the excellent quality of the submissions.  The top three contenders each came in at under one minute (the reference implementation was 169 seconds).  Five other teams also submitted implementations which were faster than the reference.  All of the submissions were open-source, and can be found [here](https://www.chia.net/2019/07/18/chia-vdf-competition-round-2-results-and-announcements.en.html).  The award total was originally $100,000, but because of the hard work that ll the teams put into the competition, we decided to award $2,000 to each team who submitted an entry, bringing the total prize money awarded to $116,000."

      line_2: "1. SIMD and GPU optimization allowed"
      line_3: "2. SIMD and GPU optimization not allowed"
      paragraph: "This is to help us separate the different kinds of optimization. We expect that the entries which use the optimizations allowed in track 1 will be faster, however there is no requirement for track 1 submission to use those techniques. This means that all track 2 submissions are also eligible for submissions to track 1. The winners of each track will receive $50,000. Individuals and teams are invited to join. Entrants will all have access to the specialized computers in Chia’s laboratory. Specifications of the reference hardware and further technical details are available on our GitHub. You can view our pre-commitment [here](https://github.com/Chia-Network/vdf-competition). Contestants will be able to communicate with Chia during the competition via a secure Keybase channel."

  #   绿皮书详细介绍了一种新的共识算法，称为空间和时间证明，即“ PoST”。 PoST取代了比特币采矿中的工作量证明，后者浪费了大量能源，并且对采矿集中化的安全性较低。
  # green_paper_addendum_title: "学到更多"
  # green_paper_addendum: |
  #   我们有学术论文和演讲，详细介绍了我们的新共识算法和区块链软件。在2019年，我们发布了《绿皮书》（https://www.chia.net/assets/ChiaGreenPaper.pdf），概述了空间和时间证明的构造，并说明了Chia的许多设计选择。麻省理工学院也有[2019年Mariano Sorgente的演讲]（https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_075bzQPooU），内容涉及如何通过空间证明和VDF实现Nakamoto共识。

  #   布拉姆·科恩（Bram Cohen）于2018年2月在斯坦福大学（太空证明）上演讲（https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zlcgt8FVz4）。我们的顾问Dan Boneh，BenediktBünz和Ben Fisch [发布了VDF调查]（https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/712.pdf），这是时间证明的基础技术。 Lipa Long [发布了有关班级分组的说明]（https://github.com/Chia-Network/vdf-competition/blob/master/classgroups.pdf），我们的《时间证明》（https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/627.pdf）。根据[学术论文]，布拉姆于2018年1月在BPASE '18上展示了[超越Hellman的时间记忆权衡与空间证明的应用]（https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqxkO7C-cyk） ]（https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/893）和Hamza Abusalah的这些[幻灯片]（https://view.publitas.com/chia-network/pbase18slides/page/1）。 Ben Fisch在2018年1月的BPASE 2018上就可验证延迟功能进行了[演讲]（https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUoagL7OZ1k）。 Bram [在伯克利的Blockchain发言人]（https://www.facebook.com/BlockchainatBerkeley/videos/2006069823011271/）（大约20:00开始）于2018年3月发布，带有[幻灯片]（https://cyber.stanford.com）。 edu / sites / g / files / sbiybj9936 / f / bramcohen.pdf）。布拉姆（Bram）在2017年1月发表了[在BPASE 2017上的演讲]（https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYG0NxoG7yw），内容涉及用时空证明（[幻灯片]（https：//cyber.stanford .edu / sites / g / files / sbiybj9936 / f / bramcohen.pdf））。

  #   Bram在SF Bitcoin Devs Seminar上进行了[演讲]（https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZaB4hM8SQ4），讨论了使用[幻灯片]扩展比特币的数据结构（https://view.publitas.com/chia -network / bitcoin_data_structures /）和[Merkle Set代码]（https://github.com/bramcohen/MerkleSet）。布拉姆（Bram）在SF比特币开发者研讨会上发表了有关消除加密货币浪费的演讲[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZaB4hM8SQ4]。
